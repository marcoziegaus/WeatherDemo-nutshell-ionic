WeatherDemo-ionic

A small Ionic app coded during a nutshell at ONE LOGIC (www.onelogic.de) do demonstrate the basics of the Ionic framework:

This app retrieves the current weather conditions for Passau, Germany and displays it on the screen. Additionally, it queries the weather forecast for the next 5 days, displays the forecasts in a list and provides detail information for each forecast.

Before running this app, please go to www/js/weather.service.js and insert your own APPID (API code for the weather REST API) to the API URL.
